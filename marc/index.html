<p><font size="5">Diving</font>'s undoubtedly a passion of mine... as is any 
excuse to be on, in or under the water. </p>
<p>I was a volunteer diver in the <a href="https://www.seattleaquarium.org/">
<font size="4">Seattle Aquarium</font></a> 40k gallon <font size="4">Pacific Coral Reef 
tank</font> every other Thurs. morning at 11am, for 8 fantastic years starting 
in '96-- if you were there then you might have seen me <a href="Aquarium.jpg">
blowing bubbles</a> and getting bitten by the Cat Shark, while cleaning the 
tank, feeding the fish, and waving to the kids.&nbsp; For a while i kept an <a href="Dive/divelog.htm">online dive log</a> of
these dives and others, along with some <a href="Dive/SeaAqDiveChart.htm">data
mining</a> from that log as well.</p>
/* <p>More recently while <a href="https://merware.net/blog">in <font size="4">Hong  */
Kong</font></a> i volunteered diving in
<a href="https://www.oceanpark.com.hk/f_index.html"><font size="4">Ocean Park</font></a>'s 
world class 50 million liter <font size="4">Coral Atoll exhibit</font><font face="Times New Roman">...
</font><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">the deep tank is spotless
</span><font face="Times New Roman">despite some large pelagic stock including 2 
mature spotted eagle rays, and several other juveniles, several black cow nose 
rays, 2 rescued green sea turtles, 4 smaller hammerheads, a bonnethead and a 
couple black tip reef sharks, many laaarge groupers&#8230; including one 80yr old 7&#8217; 
one named Grandpa, etc.&nbsp; What a privilege to play a part in maintaining 
this wonderful exhibit, with such a great crew.&nbsp; And so my
<a href="DiveInCV.htm">dive resume</a> continues to grow, and i look forward 
to my next Aquarium gig...</font></p>

<p>Part of getting out on/in/around the water means, you have to find your way

<p><b>Some work related stuff I've done:</b> </p>

<p>Haven't updated this in AGES... though definitely working on some other 
cool stuff these days, and in the past year (at least from my perspective in 2005) i've been doing it from Hong Kong 
;-).&nbsp; ...it's <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/default.mspx">
Windows Security</a> related... for now, suffice it to say you should definitely
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security/protect/default.mspx">Protect 
Your PC</a>... and 1) turn on Automatic Updates, 2) run up-to-date AV Software, 
and 3) turn on your firewall.&nbsp; I'll throw in a 4th one too... don't be a 
promiscuous surfer, use protection-- run
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security/spyware/software/default.mspx">
AntiSpyware</a> software too.&nbsp; Prior to moving out to HK, the guy who hired 
me to work on some of this stuff, who i'd worked with on/off over more than a 
decade, departed for his own journey and he logs that here...

<p>I spent several years building <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/MIServer">technology
which will allow you to get access to key data on your mobile phone</a> even if 
you were away from your desk, and perhaps out on the deck of your boat, etc.&nbsp; This 
involved acquiring and taking many trips to our Stockholm office, where I was inducted into the
ways of some <a href="images/SwedishCrabfishParty.jpg">odd Swedish traditions</a> 
called a Crabfish Party which takes place out on a boat among the fjords where 
there's no escape from the schnapps.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, back in the US, <a href="images/AirstreamTeam.JPG">some the Airstream
Team</a> showed off <a href="images/AirKeg.JPG">their version of festivities</a>
for their Swedish team member.&nbsp; This technology after shipping two 
versions, was eventually folded back into the Exchange business... in any case, 
now without a doubt you can autodial on your phone, via contacts you maintain on 
your PC w/Outlook...</p>
<p>Prior to that I worked on several versions of Exchange starting with the V1 
product we shipped, including vision for the first web client long before 
hotmail/gmail/yahoo mail, etc (via <a href="https://slipstick.com/AppFarm.htm">
ExWebZapper</a> scheduled html publisher) and ship of the first version of the 
first dynamic web client Exchange Web Access which was eventually rebranded as 
OWA (Outlook Web Access) when the web came along in prominence, various ISV 
telephony and mobile integrations, etc... 100million+ seats later the business 
is booming, and is the 3rd most commercially successful in computer software 
history, behind MS Windows and MS Office.</p>

<p>Older stuff/needs to be updated or pulled-- Should you choose to look at my <a href="groupwar.htm">Groupware
Collateral</a> Collection you'll see, among other things, an invitation to drop by
the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/technet/download/sample.asp#apps">Application
