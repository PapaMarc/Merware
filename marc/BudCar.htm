<p>It doesn't exist any more... it's now about the size and shape of a tuna can thanks to
the junk yard.&nbsp; Speaking of Brian, that's him hanging out the driver seat window.
&nbsp; He's the one who did the paint job while I was in NYC working for the week... I had
given him the car to fix my muffler, and that's what i got back.&nbsp; In the barn door,
from left to right are Terry, Dallas (he's the one who was brought up in 'the Barn'), Mike
and Don.&nbsp; I'm the one taking the picture... </p>

<p>...and here's the Bud Car hooping the dock in Bellport.</p>

<p>Not only is the car gone, but the barn has been 
<a href="http://ingridandisabella.tripod.com/isa_artinstyle0301.html">sold off to Isabella Rossellini</a>; 
gotta love where she says, &quot;I'm following in the footsteps of others.&quot;&nbsp; If 
she only knew.
Here's the view from my <a href="barn.jpg">favorite seat in the house</a>... enjoy
Isabella.</p>
