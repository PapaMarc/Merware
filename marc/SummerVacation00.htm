<h2>PreCruise Plan:</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">
Cruising to ~24 km to Patos (chart12) which is just NW of Sucia... nice bay, nice lighthouse.  We can always head back to
Sucia if we can't find moorage. That should put us ~12 km to bedwell (canadian customs) the next morn,on route
for another ~19 km to Princess Cove, Wallace Island.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Bobge also notes, &quot;on the way there's a giant oyster
fest (bbq oysters...yum yum) on lummi friday-sunday...I know a bunch of the
boaters (my brothers boat club). We could make a pit stop there on the
way...most all these people have boated between here and Alaska for years and
could give great waypointers on the rest of your trip...&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We'll meet Bob in Guemes Channel and select a route to head
on up.</p>

<h3>Cruise Journal:</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">0930 headed out of slip D24 in Anacortes Marina.&nbsp; Met
up w/Bill/Ann oustide the harbor and communicated a bit w/them and Roger and
Connier before heading off. Burned out GPS after about 5 min. in the 12V
socket... not pleased.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1015 Got our bearings after a bit of confusion and will
head around E side of Guemes I. &amp; meet Bobge by Clark Pt.&nbsp; Will pass by
W of Hat I. &amp; shoot Huckleberry &amp; Saddlebag I.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1025 1800rpm, 6.8kt</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1050 1800 rpm, 7.5kt; Coming up Jack I. to pass between it
and N tip of Guemes I (Clark Pt.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1115 met up w/Bob-- decided to cruise up E side of Lummi I.
(rather than W side)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1120 Bob along our starboard side-- took picture w/SW tip
of Lummi in view.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1130 1800rpm, 6kt, ~45psi oil, 180degF; East enough on
Lummi to now start heading up N &amp; pass to W of Eliza I</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1215 Punted on Inait Bay-- Bob didn't see his brother so
we're heading up further.&nbsp; 1800rpm, 6.6kt. Heading 304deg up Hale Passage.
Trina's making some turkey sandwiches since there's no Oyster/BBQ happening :-)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1325 Over to chart12 will head ~260deg up past Matia I. on
port bow up toward Patos-- trying to stay W of N bound traffic lane in Strait of
Georgia</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1345 Past Puffin I. &amp; just starting down Matia I.
1800rpm, 5.9kt</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1350 Trinas gone downstairs to shower... voltage gage
jumping on flying bridge.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1355 VHF on bridge not working, voltage guage steady @12.5V</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1400 Fixed radio... connection came loose under helm</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1405 Approaching N end of Sucia... my turn to shower</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1430 Between Sucia &amp; Patos... in below S of Patos a
pilot whale visited with us.&nbsp; Good cover below Patos from a decent wind
&amp; chop coming N of the island.&nbsp; Make that a pair of Pilot whales.&nbsp;
Running W in cover from the wind 1800rpm; 3.8kt (good current) for W approach to
Active Cove.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1150 Moored in mouth of Active cove in 19' water. N48
47.136&nbsp; W122 58.097&nbsp; Ended up rafting up w/Bob who also set his anchor
and then dragged back to us w/it.</p>
<h3>Journal at Port:</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">1700 Back from a hike. 23' water.&nbsp; Ranger says high is
8.3' @1930</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1900 Some wave action &amp; current passing through. Still
23'</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2000 Waves dwindling (thanks!)-- still ripping
current.&nbsp; Pulled up the crab pot, but nothing w/the current.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">0300 Serious waves but everything appears to be
holding.&nbsp; Not ideal moorage.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">0600 After checking a few more times, I'm a bit tired but
it's time for Dukes mooring constitutional.&nbsp; Appears our anchor isn't doing
much and bob is holding both of us.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">0840 Wave action finally appearing to die down.&nbsp; Not a
cloud in the sky, got the sun in my eye-- and I won't be surprised if it's a
dream (hmmm... bet that would make a good song).</p>

winds (~8kt)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">0955 Crossing border</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1035 1800rpm, 6kt. Off of Taylor Pt, Saturna. Adjusted GPS
to read Track as 'Auto Mag Variation'. Trina's doing the dishes-- the voltage
gauge is jumping again.&nbsp; Must be related to the water pump.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1110 5min to Tilly Poin, S Pender.&nbsp; Just came up from
below to check phone charge; It was ringing.&nbsp; I spoke w/slawler who wanted
to know my office preference for the new building move.&nbsp; I thanked him and
said I'd take a Pod somewhere central the various wireless apps/core teams.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1123 Entering Bedwell harbor</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1153 Heading out of Bedwell. CA Customs Clearance #V203390.
Check to make sure we have Duke's Rabies vacination history.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1205 1800rpm, 6.3kt, 45psi, 180degF; Going to punt on going
all the way up to Wallace Pt.&nbsp; Instead will try Prevost's Selby Cove</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1220 1800rpm, 7.8kt; 2-3nm up S and (SW side) on N Pender
toward Boat Nook. Trina's going below to shower... I'll watch the volt gauge.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1236 @ Boat Nook; 1800rpm, 8.1kt; Voltage gauge does jump
w/water pump.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1320 Approaching 3rd cove which is Selby Cove.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1355 Anchored in 17.5' water; ~50' chain out-- very soft
bottom.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Journal at Port:</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">1500 A short nap-- we haven't moved so anchor's definitely
set.&nbsp; Took Duke for a walk at the southern most toe of the cove.&nbsp;
Hardly a 'sandy' beach as Wag suggests... muck/mud is a better
description.&nbsp; And now there IS a private property sign &amp; no sign of a
farmhouse.&nbsp; Nevertheless, we threw the ball in the water for Duke.&nbsp; He
seemed confused by the salt water taste.&nbsp; He keep spitting the ball out and
then batting it around in the mud.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1530 Time to read and snooze.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1700 Played some chess w/Trina.&nbsp; Depth is now 23' so I
let out another 15' chain.&nbsp; One more boat joined us in the cove, as did
someone living in a house on the cove accessible by boat.&nbsp; Otherwise...
besides the muskrat we saw swimming and the Eagle we heard, we're alone.&nbsp;
Found a great candian classic rock station (92.8 KISM, Bellingham)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2200 Lengthened the scope a bit as the tide seems to
continue to come up.&nbsp; 100' of chain now out.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">0600 Flat calm, no wind-- was a great night, and we all
slept soundly.&nbsp; Much nicer than last eve. in Patos' Active Cove. Trina
rowed Duke (and me) in for his morning walk, this time on a rocky cliff across
from our boat on the NE shore about halfway in the cove.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">0800 Great morning in Selby cove.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now
Trina's got the smokies and eggs on the burners-- smells great..&nbsp; We've
been eating well-- I barbequed NY strip steaks that past 2 evenings, along w/a
greek salad and red potatoes which Trina whipped up.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1200 Really enjoying this cove, the weather and our little
family.&nbsp; Took Duke up to explore the rocky beach and rock knoll at the
mouth of the cove--&nbsp; the SW molar of the mouth so to speak.&nbsp; We played
there for an hour, having Duke chase the ball and swim, and climb up the rock to
the knoll portion.&nbsp; On the way back saw a bald eagle perched on a tree
overlooking our fine craft-- I snapped some pictures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h1><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Monday Morning Underway</b></h1>
<h2>PreCruise Plan:</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Cruise 13 km NE to N. Pender's Port Browning (Chart11,

Pender too passing Mayne I. off to port.&nbsp; Then around Razor Pt. and into
Port Browning.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Weather/Sea Condition: clear, sunny skies</p>
<h3>Cruise Journal:</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">1215 started engine.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1240 Underway at 1650rpm, 6kt &amp; motoring out of Selby
Cove.&nbsp; We're taking our time-- it's a beautiful day.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1300 I hosed down the anchor and deck.&nbsp; We saw a seal
off the N tip of Prevost once running SE along Galiano I.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1310 I went down to shower-- the water hardly heats up
w/45+min!&nbsp; Trina's cut power back to 1500rpm, 6kt.&nbsp; We're now @SE tip
of Prevost, crossing over to N Pender along Mayne I. There appears to be a
sailboat race between N Pendere and Mayne I... we'll cruise past closer to N
Pender shore &amp; keep the sailboats off to port.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1330 up to 1700rpm, 7.6-8kt</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1335 back down to 1500, 7.3kt; beautiful sailing ships--
got lots of pictures.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1350 Fane I. off to our starboard bow. Trina's brought up
some yummy sandwiches.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1400 Lots of seals here in Plumper Sound.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1430 Approaching Port Browning, N. Pender. 1500rpm, 6.6kt,
45psi, 180degF.&nbsp; Beautiful, sunny, cloudless, windless (water ever so
slightly rippled) cruising day.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1448 We're anchored in 19.5' water and I've put out ~80'
chain.&nbsp; Today's trip was 12.6nm, avg.5.7kt, max8.4kt, 2hr11min.&nbsp; Trina
took a shower (after another 1.5 hrs, w/engine at 180deg)-- water's still cold
after that cruise.</p>
<h3>Journal at Port:</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">1515 13'</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1718 Back from excursion into town.&nbsp; Bought the
essentials: 1/2 dozen eggs, coconut rum and pineapple juice.&nbsp; Now we have
22' water.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1900 Great sloppy joes.&nbsp; An otter off our starboard
bow seemed to be enjoying his sushi dinner as well. 27' water-- I let out some
more chain; we now have 100' in.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2150 Sun's down.&nbsp; We're back from Duke's last walk for
the day.&nbsp; He's gone up to sit on the cool cushions on the flying
bridge.&nbsp; I'm sitting in the captains chair down below.&nbsp; When I poke my
head out and whisper his name, he rolls his head over the side from where he's
lying, and looks down attentively.&nbsp; What a good boy.&nbsp; I wonder if he
too is enjoying the Merle Haggard...</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">0427 Heard the dingy banging into the swim step.&nbsp; Went
outside to adjust... not much wind (1kt) but current was shifting around and as
the boat was swinging the dingy got caught up to windward.&nbsp; I shifted it
around, and went back to sleep.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">0630 Duke says it's time to get up and go ashore, so like
obedient masters we attended to his demands.&nbsp; 14' water this morning.&nbsp;
This cove is protected too-- it was a quite night.&nbsp; But the houses&nbsp;
around the cove, particularly on the N shore have some noisy kids by day.&nbsp;
The town here is good for supplies (particularly the market in town); though the
marina, even though the building is redone, is hardly setup as a marina.&nbsp;
No marine shop, no tide reports.&nbsp; There is a cafe which looked nice, though
we've done all our own cooking. We definitely enjoyed the solitude of Shelby
cove, and probably weren't ready for civilization just yet.&nbsp; I think we'll
go take a nap.</p>

<h3>Cruise Journal:</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">0930 Getting really shallow in our anchorage and
choppier... so we decided to pull anchor &amp; head out.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">0940 Motoring out of Port Browning with coffee in hand and
breakfast on the way. 1200rpm, 5.1kt.&nbsp; Haven't been able to get in touch w/Toddr
but we'll shoot for Montague on the chance that he'll be there today (per
precruise plan).&nbsp; Lots of clouds-- where did our great weather go!? Staying
below for now where it's warm.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">0955 Clouds/fog are blowing over us as we head out.&nbsp;
We'll bear NW now-- it looks clear up there :-) out toward Montague.&nbsp; I'll
step it up to 1400rpm, 6.1kt w/the cross wind off from starboard.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1030 1400rpm, 7.6kt. Entering Navy Channel; lots of seals.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1040 Up to flying bridge and up to 1500rpm, 7.8kt (noticed
the flying bridge rpm gauge reads 1k lower than the gauge below ie. 1300 rather
than 1400).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1100 Just below &amp; had a shave.&nbsp; Back up &amp;
pushing up to 1800rpm, 5.9kt to assist from getting blown about. between Mayne
I's &quot;Helen Pt.&quot; and Galiano's &quot;Collinson Pt.&quot; with Prevost I
to port. and wind coming across port stern from the South.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1115 Todd, Jenny, Nice, Robin and friend just motored up to
us near SE entry to Montague, past Phillimore Pt. in their 17' whaler loaded
w/all their camping gear.&nbsp; To 1600rpm, 7kt.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1150 Moored in Montague.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1154 On one of the many mooring buoys in the North
end.&nbsp; Trip summary: 12.8nm, avg 5.9kt, max.8.4kt, 2hr10min.&nbsp; Adjusted
mooring lines so that we have two lines each doubled through the bow cleats.</p>
<h3>Journal at Port:</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">1325 Had a great mac &amp; cheese lunch, tidy'ed up the
deck, and now we'll take Duke ashore and have him lead us to TJNR's campsite!
(34' water where we're moored)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1715 Back from our excursion.&nbsp; We met up w/Todd and
crew (and a big crew at that).&nbsp; John and his kids, John's dad Mike, and
Rick and his kids.&nbsp; We hiked all around w/the gang... Duke had a ball on
one of the sandy beaches that we parked at for a good hour.&nbsp; He played ball
non-stop.&nbsp; A slew of other kids kept him busy when I got tired, and then a
couple dogs and their owners came by and Duke played w/the dogs.&nbsp; Then we
took Todd's whaler over to the marina/stores.&nbsp; On the way back, Todd, Jenny
and the kids came aboard our vessel.&nbsp; We'll probably join them after dinner
for smores and campfire stories.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Got talking w/Rick while waiting outside the marina stores
w/Duke.&nbsp; He and his wife run a restaurant on San Juan called Duck
Soup.&nbsp; He told us about an interesting route on the way back, so we'll
probably make an early start tomorrow and try that.&nbsp; It's roughly 42nm out
of the NW approach of Montague (chart 11), up N around the top of Saltspring I.
(chart 10) and down between Saltspring and Vancouver I. through the Sansum
Narrows, into Satellite Channel (chart 9), through Shute Passage @79deg over to
Prevost Passage and then 97deg over into (chart8) Roche Harbor to clear US
Customs... before heading another 3-4nm into Garrison Bay where we plan to meet
Bill and Ann.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1930 Finished a great dinner w/Trina.&nbsp; I BBQ'd some
chicken and Trina made up some wild rice and green beans... that was a great
compliment to the coconut rum and pineapple juice.&nbsp; We're going to head
over to the campsite with smores materials, and join the campers.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2200 Back from an evening at the campsite.&nbsp; We enjoyed
desert, Robin was among the happy campers, Nick played w/Duke all eve., as Todd,
Jenny and Rick studied the charts and mapped out tomorrow's excursion. We hiked
over to the westward beach, covered in oyster shells, and watched the sunset.
Now we're back on board, and ready to get a great nights sleep in preparation
for what should be a long, and scenic cruise tomorrow.&nbsp; It's flat calm,
windless and quiet in the harbor-- we should sleep well.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">0550 Took Duke ashore for one last walk around the park;
passed by the Roberts campsite and everyone seemed to be sleeping soundly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">0656 Underway and motoring out of Montague @1000rpm, 4.8kt.
Great night-- flat calm, no wind, &amp; silent. We'll head up NW though, there
appears to be some clouds up that way, before heading bck down along the west
side of Saltspring I.&nbsp; On the way out we're passing the NE shore/beach
where we played yesterday with the Dukester. &lt;picture&gt;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">0713 Moved up to 1800rpm, 6.9kt and the GPS says the total

<p class="MsoNormal">0803 2nd 3rd of the way up Wallace we passed another neat
anchorage inside a rocky shoal.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">0820 Rounding Saltspring's &quot;Southey Pt&quot; (which is
the northern most tip) in Houston Passage. Nice little cove at this point
(though appears that it would be exposed to winds from the north, similar to
Patos' Active Cove, though presumably nowhere near the same deal of current).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">0915 Looks like a fish farm on Vancouver I. between Grave

<p class="MsoNormal">0942 Another nice house overlooking the narrows looking
East on Vancouver I's Sansum Pt &lt;photo&gt;. Lots of little whirlpools at the

a big rocky cliff. &lt;picture&gt; Lots more eddies and we're moving @ 8kt,
1800rpm.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">0955 Heading out of the narrows &amp; into Satellite channel-- I'm going below to shower.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1023 Up from my shower... a hint of warmer water after 3hrs

<h3>Journal at Port:</h3>
<p>1506 Back from walk ashore with Duke.&nbsp; Now we have 7.6' water. We spent
time gazing around English camp.</p>
<p>Rest of evening: Bill and Ann arrived 1600ish with Buck and Nancy
Jorgenson.&nbsp; We spent more time ashore at English camp, and then a nice
evening on the Downtime.&nbsp; Chatted w/Buck about his apple orchard while
enjoying some cheese and crackers. Great bacon wrapped steaks, salad, potatoes
and some cabernet was the fare for the eve-- enjoyed thoroughly by all.&nbsp;
More time ashore later that eve, and ~0700 the next morning with the dog before
joining them in the morning for breakfast including bacon, smokies, yogurt,
coffee, etc.</p>
<p>1030 Left the Sara L at her anchorage, and boarded Downtime to cruise out
along the west side of San Juan to see if we can spot some whales.&nbsp; We
spend a few hours out an about w/them before we all head back into Garrison to
split off and take the Sara L out to Cypress I.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill/Ann and crew
will sail the Downtime to Sucia.</p>
<p>1300 Back from milling about-- saw lots of dolphins and dall's porpoises
between Pile Pt and Like Kiln... mostly lower by pile.&nbsp; The
dolphins/porpoises swam with us as we were motoring northward back up to
Garrison.&nbsp; As we got up to Orcas we passed a pod of Orcas swimming
southward.&nbsp; That was awesome.</p>
<h1><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Thursday Morning</b></h1>
<h2>PreCruise Plan:</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Cruise x km to Cypress I. Eagle Harbor (p.78 Wag, p.252
Cruise).&nbsp; It's shallow.&nbsp; Enter slow and favor N. shore. At low tide and watch for submerged
pilings, and shoal in middle. Miles of hiking trails.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">it's clearly shorter ( ~24km) to go across on top of San Juan, Shaw and Lopez through
Obstruction or Peavine Pass... but this will be the 2nd to last morn. cruise and we could take the longer route (~38) around the
bottom of San Juan and Lopez and then up to Cypress.  I'm leaning in the direction of the
longer route, since I've done the other (trafficked) route before, and suspect our chance of seeing some
whales of some sort might be decent going around the bottom/outside along Rosario Strait.&nbsp;
Toddr suggested, if we &quot;want to see whales, the west side of San Juan is the best
place to be. We've seen them out there this past weekend and a couple days last week. Nick and I did a sightseeing flight and could
see the whales swimming around under water - pretty cool.&nbsp; Which way you go depends a little bit on the weather. It could get
pretty rough on the west side of San Juan, but it shouldn't be a big concern this time of year.&quot;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If we do an extra day on Saturday, then we cruise to Lopez
I's Mackaye Harbor (p. 89 Wag, p. 287 Cruise.)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">1424 started engine</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1430 Motoring out of Garrison Bay at 1000rpm, 4.4kt</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1444 Heading out into water off San Juan's White Pt. up to
1800rpm, 6.1kt. We're going to head back around the West side of San Juan and
look for more marine mammals.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1505 Motoring down to Lime Kiln Pt-- can see the
lighthouse. 1800rpm, 9.4kt</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1530 We're between Lime Kiln &amp; Pile Pt. and now the
current/eddies are definitely working against us.&nbsp; We've slowed to 4.3kt at
1800rpm.&nbsp; Just to make sure we didn't have any mechanical problems, or kelp
on the prop because it did relatively feel like we were driving w/the breaks on,
we did a 180deg spin and we shot up to 10kt! ie. a 3kt current against us.&nbsp;
Saw a couple of porpoise again-- though this time they were a couple 100 yards
further offshore from us rather than swimming directly around and under the boat
as they were earlier when we were out on the Downtime.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1620 We're now about half way or less down between the
South end of False bay and Eagle Pt.&nbsp; We're picking up a bit now to a
whooping 5.9kt (at 1800rpm). Not the most exciting run w/out the whales...</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1703 We're crossing San Juan Channel eastward at 5.7kt,
1800rpm...&nbsp; will go below Long I. and Charles I. and then head up North
into Mackeye Harbor. Clear blue sky, and nice breeze, water slightly rippled.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1710 The Orca pod is headed West, and then eventually back
North from earlier this morn! Saw 4 Orcas playing and breeching between Charles
Island and mid way into San Juan Channel (between Charles I and San Juan's
Cattle Point). Then saw 2 more, then 3 more then 2 more! The last one popped up
to take a breath at 1730 no more than 20' off our starboard bow.&nbsp; Very
cool!&nbsp; Duke was whistling at them-- He really wanted to jump in and swim
with them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1757 1500rpm, 7.1kt. Heading North up to Richardson fuel
tanks on route into Lopez Island's Mackeye harbor.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1804 Anchored in 15' water (60' chain) by the Eastern,
public access shore in Mackey Harbor.&nbsp; I shut the engine down, reading
1511.9hrs.&nbsp; Trip computer says we did 19.7nm from Garrison, avg5.4kt,
max10.7kt with a trip time of 3hr37min.</p>
<h3>Journal at Port:</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">1830 We took the boy ashore and set a crab pot.&nbsp; It's
quite calm and peaceful. Noone's around except for a couple locals enjoying the
afternoon of sun and slight breeze-- a nice old, small catboat rig, and a sporty
hobie 16'.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2210 Pulled the crab pot... nothing.&nbsp; We're starting
to see some rollers coming in from beyond Charles, which is causing us to roll a
bit given that the boat is swinging around and taking them broadside. This east
shore is a bit exposed.&nbsp; I set a Danforth anchor off the stern so the bow
faces wsw into the rollers.</p>

<h3>Cruise Journal:</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">0530 Duke's up.&nbsp; Took a look outside-- we're
totally socked in by fog.&nbsp; Hopefully if we go back to sleep for an hour
some of it will burn off.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">0750 Pulled the stern anchor which worked great last night,
and then the bow anchor and were underway.&nbsp; Sprayed down the anchor, deck
and dingy.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">0810 Cruising out of Mackeye... fog appears to be
lifting/burning off a bit. There's now about 2-3mi visibility. Up to 1800rpm,
7.3kt.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">0850 Cut back to 1200rpm, 5k for the past 10 min.&nbsp;
Could see only a few feet in front of our boat... and heard a fog horn from one
of the big ships in the Rosario Strait shipping lanes.&nbsp; Definitely spooky
being in total fog and hearing that. Just closely monitored the charts/gps and
made sure we were inside the shipping lanes and off the rocks. Now I can see a
clear shot between Colville I. and Pt. Colville toward the SE tip of
Lopez.&nbsp; Will shoot it at 1800rpm, 6kt.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">0900 Off Pt Colville and looking foggy ahead.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">0910 Rounding Watmough Head and can now see Boulder Rock as
expected given charts/gps.&nbsp; I'm staying to East of Boulder Rock.&nbsp; Lots
of fog-- about a 1/4nm visibility at best.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">0930 Kellett Lady is in sight, and fog has lifted a
bit.&nbsp; Will motor up there before crossing Rosario Strait.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">0945 Just shy of Kellet Lady and fog has lifted a
bit.&nbsp; There are ships moving&nbsp; both directions.&nbsp; I'm going to
attempt to cross over to Burrows I.&nbsp; At least now the ships will clearly
see us and know our intent.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">0954 Went ahead of the tug and sand barges going</o:p>
 Southbound and below the tug and barge going northbound (and pushed up to
2000rpm, 7.4kt for the maneuver).&nbsp; Then back down to 1800rpm.&nbsp; We
passed quite cleanly, and I had wanted to cross when I/they could see, and
before the fog closed back in again which it does quite quickly, and w/out any
significant warning; I really didn't want to cross in the fog.&nbsp; Hindsight
suggested I could have let the first tug going southbound (while we were going
northbound) close on us, and go behind him, and then behind the other.&nbsp; I
just didn't want to move toward him head on in fog...
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1030 Rounding Shannon Pt into Guemes Channel.&nbsp; The
barge we passed behind (heading northbound) is to our port.&nbsp; 1 ferry has
come into Ship Harbor, and another is loading to presumably depart
shortly.&nbsp; I'll watch closely. 1800rpm, 4.8kt heading East into Guemes.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1130 Outside Anacortes marina.&nbsp; There are several
boats (charters coming in) queuing at the fuel dock so we're hovering just
outside the marina entry. Trip computer shows 19.4nm, Avg 5.7kt, max 10.7kt,
3hr23min.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1308 In slipD24, shutting down engine (took a loooong time
to get to fuel dock).&nbsp; All in all a fantastic week.
</p>
<h3>Journal at Port:</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">Turned in all paperwork and key to the AYC folks.&nbsp; In
general, we thought this was a super charter organization. They really run like
a well oiled machine, w/a variety of crews at the fuel dock refueling dingy
gerry cans, propane while you're refueling w/diesel, checkout/in people meeting
every boat (Oleg in our case) going over everything on the vessel, divers
dropping the water to checkout the hull, cleaning crews scheduled for a pass
through the ship, people at the front desk making sure the paperwork is in
order.&nbsp; It's quite painless as the charterer and we'll do it again w/them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Spent a bit of time at Cap Sante marina, and Skipper Cress
Yacht Sales with Iain walking aboard a new Nordic Tug 42' with the flying
bridge.&nbsp; Beautiful vessel, ample salon area and an awesome (though
separate/closed off from salon) bridge-- a magnificently wired main panel under
the helm. After spending the week on the CHB, similar to Bob's Grand Banks
configuration, we really like the two full staterooms, w/the master stateroom in
the rear.&nbsp; Also appreciated the close proximity of the&nbsp; galley/bridge
and salon...</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1920 Caught the evening showing of &quot;The Perfect
Storm&quot; about the Andrea Gail swordfish boat lost off the Grand Banks in
1991. Trina has wanted to read the book, and was going to take it along on our
cruise-- which I strongly advised against her doing.&nbsp; The movie was as sad,
as the book was frightening.&nbsp; Now I'll get her a copy of the book
:-).&nbsp; Also have to get in touch w/Jeff-- seems his Dad's boat
&quot;Midnight Sun&quot; is seen motoring in a clip in the opening of the movie.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Other Notes:</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal">0530 Saturday morning.&nbsp; Heard the wind and water
outside.&nbsp; Disoriented a bit as it felt just a bit too soft, comfortable,
and entirely too still to match the wind and waves I was hearing... Then
realized I was sleeping in my own bed at home.&nbsp; A renewed sense of calm and
comfort... rolled over and back to sleep until 0730 before we got up and took
Duke out for his morning swim.</p>
