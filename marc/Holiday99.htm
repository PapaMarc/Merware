<p class="MsoNormal">Dear Family &amp; Friends,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The first full calendar year of our marriage has passed and
it has been full of adventures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
brought in 1999 at home with each other watching the New Year’s festivities at
the Space Needle.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In February, I left Attachmate and by March I was back at
Microsoft.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I’m working as a
Product Manager in the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/preview"> marketing group for Exchange
Server</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Yes, that’s the same product Marc works on building
wireless connectivity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Our offices
are in the same building, one floor apart-- we have been carpooling a few days a
week.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Although this gives us a lot
of quality time together since traffic continues to get more unbearable, it also
results in challenges as we try to mesh our schedules.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I’m really enjoying my new job.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It’s kept me busy and has sent me traveling quite a bit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Since March, I’ve seen the Crown Jewels in London, tested my rusty
German in Hamburg and Frankfurt (home of Hamburgers and Hotdogs), and will make
a quick trip to Dublin before Christmas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
also got a chance to visit my dear friend, Ali, in Atlanta when we held our
annual Exchange Conference there in October.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was fun to catch up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I’m
still waiting for the trips to Anchorage and Tokyo to come along so I can visit
Christie and Mark.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Marc’s been
working hard as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He made many
trips to Scandinavia <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/KM/ICSA/default.asp"> helping Microsoft acquire a Swedish wireless software
company</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He’s hired a team of
people to work for him and is making progress towards shipping their first
product which provides the underpinnings for the “Wireless Web” you’ll be
hearing about increasingly in the media.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Our good friends Rachel and Danny got married in June in
New York, so we went out to enjoy the festivities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was a beautiful wedding and it also provided us the opportunity to
visit with Bob &amp; Judy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We also
met Mike &amp; Jessie’s twins, Jack and Sam for the first time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>At the time, they were just a few months old and were very cute.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In July, Marc and I <a href="SummerVacation99.htm"> chartered a 32’ Nordic Tug and
cruised around the San Juan and Canadian Gulf Islands for a week</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Marc did a great job as <a href="images/skipper.jpg"> Skipper</a> while I, as the the First Mate, took care
of the anchor, lines, and all the cooking in the Galley.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We had beautiful weather all week.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
caught and cooked a fresh crab, saw a seal giving birth on a rock by Sucia
Island, and did plenty of hiking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
was a wonderfully relaxing week.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What
a great way to take advantage of the beautiful northwest summer<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>– something we’d like to repeat each year.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">August brought another wedding of two close friends,
Desteni and Brian.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Marc and I were
honored to be candle lighters in the wedding.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Jill, Jeff &amp; the kids visited us for a week before Labor Day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Jackson and Ginger continue to grow by leaps and bounds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We started our first anniversary celebration the same way as our
honeymoon—in a <a href="http://www.kenmoreair.com/"> Kenmore Air float plane</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
time we were bound for a long weekend in Victoria, B.C.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In October, we adopted a wonderful 10-month old black lab
puppy from our vet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The puppy had
swallowed part of a rug and it’s elderly owners wanted to put him down since
he was too much to take care of.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
vet did the emergency surgery to remove the rug bits, with the agreement that
she would find the dog a new home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
happened to bring Tabby in to the vet to check her claws, and fell in love with
Gus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So, we brought him home on a
Wednesday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He was already
housebroken and learned obedience commands very quickly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We took him for lots of walks, played fetch with him in the back yard and
Marc built a big kennel in the backyard on Saturday, so he could stay outside
while we’re at work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But, Gus
wasn’t eating right and was by Sunday was acting very lethargic and throwing
up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We took him back to the vet
where we learned he wasn’t healing correctly from his first surgery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>They did emergency surgery again, but unfortunately Gus didn’t make it
through.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Although we only had Gus
for 5 days, he stole our hearts and we were devastated when he died.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He was such a good boy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
miss him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We are looking for a new
dog and will know when the right one comes along.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Marc is keeping busy this fall working on our drainage
problems (very common in Seattle).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
has now triumphed over the rain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
are looking forward to spending the holidays here at home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We will ring in the millennium in Vancouver with Pat and Cameron (no, we
won’t be in a bomb shelter 10 feet under and our PCs will continue to work on
January 1-- though we look forward to joining the rest of you in waking up
before we were born on the 1st day of the new millenium).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As a special added bonus for those of you who are not
Online-challenged we'd also like to share these late breaking inclusions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Marc and Trina started the year off in January dressed
    in black tie and evening gown at the Seattle Opera by seeing Mozart's Don
    Giovanni. Marc shed the tux and headed for the trucks with friend Todd at
    (insert frenzied, high pitched, echo enhanced voice) 'the U.S. Hot Rod
    Monster Jam in the Kingdome'. In February M &amp; T saw the Pacific
    Northwest Ballet's presentation of Cinderella (she yet again found the glass
    slipper she invariably loses each time she goes to the ball). Early June
    brought M&amp;T to New York with Bob and Judy and were amazed by the 'Shackleton's
    Legendary Expedition: The Endurance' in the American Museum of Natural
    History's gallery 77.&nbsp; During the summer Trina learned how to waterski!!&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In July <a href="images/pianoman.jpg"> Marc sang &quot;Piano Man&quot;</a> in a 'pick up band' with
    Neil's talented buddy, who also happens to be Billy
    Joel's sax player <a href="http://www.markrivera.com">Mark Rivera</a>,
    backing him up (OK-- bailing him out was more like it, not only on sax, but
    by helping with the words for just about every verse but the chorus; sorry
    Billy, and thanks Mark). In August Marc met Trina in Vegas along with friends Neil/Kristin
    (on the way back from a Stockholm trip, where he happened to take a few
    hours to visit <a href="http://www.skansen.se">Skansen</a> and see the
    worlds smallest monkey-- I was thinking of you POJ!-- and take part in a
    traditional <a href="images/Swedish%20Crabfish%20Party.jpg">Swedish Crabfish
    Party</a>) for a non-stop weekend
    of true Vegas-style excess which included Cirque du Soleil's &quot;O&quot;,
    a tour of the Bellagio's Gallery of fine art, and and evening at the Hard
    Rock's Joint to see Tom Petty live in concert. Had so much fun on the
    concert tour, that in October Neil and Marc flew to Oakland to see Bruce
    Springsteen and the E Street Band... we even played pinball with Little
    Stevie back stage.&nbsp; Also in October M&amp;T went to <a href="http://www.benaroyahall.com"> Benaroya Hall</a> for
    some Baroque music. We've included a small recap of <a href="FreshOysters.htm">our
    Oyster picks</a>, while at dinner at &quot;The Brooklyn&quot; on a year end,
    December trip out to the hear Handel's Messiah at Benaroya Hall with Trina's
    folks Bill and Ann and friend Cameron. On 12/18/99 Marc actually, stop the
    presses,&nbsp; played a
    round of golf at the Tournament Player's Course at Snoqualmie Ridge with
    Jimre; Marc shot a solid 152 to Jim's clean 95.&nbsp; <a href="14thhole.jpg">Here he is</a> on the 14th
    hole clearing Bear's Canyon, sporting a pair of pants he 'borrowed' from
    Dallas years ago.</li>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Somewhere in there, and even he doesn't know where,
    Marc caught a sailfish (while strapped into the virtual fighting chair--
    Neil, Kristin &amp; Mike Silva gaped in awe) at Gameworks in Seattle.&nbsp;
    Additionally, Marc attended a variety of Mariner games (v. Yankees, Twins,
    and Tigers) at <a href="http://www.safecofield.com"> SafeCo field</a> with Johnpal, Davidgo and Trina respectively,
    and a Sonics game at Key Arena with Patcar (Marc does have the ticket stubs
    handy for those games; <a href="mailto:marcse@microsoft.com">mailto:marcse</a>
    should you care for more detail on date, section, row and seat details :-).</li>
