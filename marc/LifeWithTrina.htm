    <p><b>My life  with Trina:</b></p>
</h1>

<p>Trina and I got married during the summer of '98... see the <a href="wedding98.htm">Wedding98 page</a>.&nbsp;
We enjoyed diving, cruising, and found just about any other excuse to be on or 
around the water together.&nbsp; <a href="tabby.htm">Tabby</a>, our cat, is not 
a water fan.&nbsp; She had no appreciation for the water, no matter
how much <a href="metnj.jpg">Trina (my better half, pictured here
w/me and nephew J-man)</a> and I tried to convince her.</p>

<p>Trina was the launch manager for <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/Exchange">Exchange
Server 2000</a>, did a tour on the Office marketing team doing PR for <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/Sharepoint/">Sharepoint</a>, 
and is currently working on Content Management Server...
here's just <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/sp/stories/news/0,4538,2767904,00.html">one
of many examples of what she's been up to</a>.&nbsp; We met several years ago while working on the first version of
Exchange Server.</p>
<p>We founded and endowed the <a href="../VBS/default.htm">Victor B. Scheffer 
foundation</a>... out of total loving, friendship and respect for grandfather, a 
living legend in his own right.</p>

<p>For the 2000 in review, checkout the online version of our <a href="Holiday00.htm">Holiday
Letter</a> to friends and family.&nbsp; And if you're into history, the <a href="Holiday99.htm">'99
Letter</a> is available. For a long time i kept telling myself that one of these 
days, <a href="https://www.kenmoreair.com/">I was going to fly for these guys</a>... 
but it wasn't to be the future.</p>
<p>At this point, this is all history now... as is our 
marriage.&nbsp; 2002 was a tough year... glad that's behind us both now.&nbsp; 
Duke's with me, and Tabby's with Trina.&nbsp; And life goes on...</p>
