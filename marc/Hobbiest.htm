		<font size="4">Garmin GPS navigation</font>
	<p>&nbsp;
	<p>Back in the day, I had a
		classic, original
		<a href="http://www.Garmin.com">Garmin</a> 45 GPS and it was good.&nbsp; THE
		references at that time were:
	<ul>
		<li>&nbsp;<a href="http://vancouver-webpages.com/peter/g45faq.txt">Lane A.
				Holdcroft's FAQ</a>, and</li>
		<li>if you were into being a bit of a hobbiest
			<a href="http://www.pfranc.com/projects/g45contr/g45_idx.htm">Larry's
				p(urple)Plug page</a> bridged the gap of the proprietary garmin power/data
			connector with the world of other standardized, easily accessible electronic
			components... in short, they provided you the goods, and the instruction on
			how to build power, data and power/data cables while at the same time saving
			a few bucks. A first in open hardware development and manufacturing.&nbsp;
			Great stuff-- hours of fun, followed by years of satisfying use.
		</li>
		<li>With respect to software...
			<ul>
				<li>i still use those cables today in '05 when i connect my GarminIII+
					to my laptop running
					<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/streets/default.mspx">Microsoft
						Streets &amp; Trips</a> when i go road tripping.
				</li>
				<li>and for the boaters out there, there's
					<a href="http://www.nobeltec.com">Nobeltec</a>'s software for
					state-of-the-art nautical use.&nbsp; This stuff is serious (as the
					nautical navigation hardware boys eventually realized as their buyout
					history reflects)!
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>&nbsp;
	<p>
		<font size="4">ScubaPro/Uwatec/Aladin SCUBA dive computers</font>
	<p>&nbsp;
	<p>Even as i start
		writing this about ScubaPro's line of <a href="http://www.uwatec.com/">
			Uwatec dive computers</a> i feel compelled to make a mention of
		<a
			href="http://www.suunto.com/suunto/main/article_2column.jsp?CONTENT&lt;&gt;cnt_id=10134198673939095&FOLDER&lt;&gt;folder_id=1408474395903548">
			Suunto dive computers</a> which are hot on the Aladin product line's fins...
		the new
		<a href="http://www.aquanaut.com.au/products/sa.shr/computerbrand_product/1/4/4/0/510">
			Suunto D9</a> appears to be a force to be reconned with, though i haven't
		yet dove it and for now stand by my trusty Uwatec Air Z Nitrox, along with a
		ScubaPro MK20 first stage, and G250HP 2nd stage.&nbsp; I think in general, the
		lifetime warranty on ScubaPro's regulators (provided you service it every year) is the best
		in the industry... and this is the equipment i bet on when below the surface.&nbsp;
		I am also intrigued by the promise of
		<a href="http://www.isracast.com/tech_news/310505_tech.htm">Alon Bodner's work</a>...
		and I would LOVE to be an alpha tester, though no doubt i'd do so w/the 'kit' i
		mentioned hooked up to at least a pony bottle as backup should the batteries run
		low, or the electronics short out, etc.
	<p>Back to the Aladin line of dive computers... a bit old school
		perhaps at this point, but a great friendly model to dive, big enough on your wrist so
		that you don't have to strain to see the key limiting factors, etc... and
		smart enough they can handle Nitrox, and deco cases for the recreational
		diver who's spreading his wings a bit... this line of Aladin models
		(irrespective of whether it was nitrox enabled, or air integrated as the Air Z
		Nitrox is) were somewhere between:
	<ul>
		<li>the techy <a href="http://www.divecochran.com/">Cochran computers</a>
			(good for the SEALs and those
			<a href="http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/technology/diving/technical/technical.html">
				tech diving</a> w/TriMix, etc) w/more data than you can shake a stick at
			which might as a recreational sport diver overcomplicate the key
			decisions you need to make at any one time to minimize risk, and the
		</li>
		<li>so-GUI-it oozes, color graphical animated displays (various models
			not named built of the same core and OEM'ed by various Scuba
			manufacturers who needed a dive computer to add to their line) which are
			arguably a little too smart for their own good in making key decisions
			for you v. giving you the data you want to make life/death decisions for
			my taste, AND are missing the more hobbiest community following for
			software and downloading harnesses.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>So again, back to the Aladin line (could swear i said that before)...
		this is a line of proven dive computers (back by a proven dive model)
		and for the last decade has been somewhat of the defacto standard in the
		industry.&nbsp; And it has a has a community of hobbiest, PC savvy followers.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Namely, there are folks on the software side of things... while
			i won't attempt to recreate and maintain
			<a href="http://www.muenster.de/~matthias/aladin/rightlinks.htm">THE
				Linked List</a>; rather i'll point you at a good one.&nbsp; I always found
			<a href="http://www.temesvari.de/wlog/wlog.htm">Thomas's
				W(indows)Log</a>, <a href="http://www.vanwaasen.de/">Jochen's ADLT</a>,
			&amp;
			<a href="http://subaqua.web.cern.ch/subaqua/techniques/ADTK/ADTK.HTM">
				Dive Talk</a> worth playing with.&nbsp;
		</li>
		<li>And there are the folks on the download harness hardware side,
			starting with
			<a href="http://www.muenster.de/~matthias/aladin/building.htm">
				Matthias</a> whose design i built years back and still use to this
			day. And others notably
			<a href="http://www.tele.ucl.ac.be/PEOPLE/DOUXCHAMPS/aladin/english/bi_oa.html">
				DDouxchamps</a> who squeezed the BiDi-OpAmp design down via SMD to
			fit into a DB9 connector-- still beyond my ability to create at
			home.&nbsp; Nevertheless, for a few bucks and a bit of sweat and
			persistence these guys enabled you to download your data.&nbsp; This was a
			great alternative, in contrast to the several hundred ScubaPro/Uwatec
			charged/es for its bulky, overengineered and now antiquated
			<a href="http://uwatecusbeta.scubapro.com/products/datatrak_memo_mouse/datatrak_memo_mouse.asp">
				MemoMouse</a>.&nbsp; While the folks at Uwatec have at this point
			moved on to InfraRed (why not straight to BlueTooth, which doesn't
			have the line of sight positioning limitation?) for their newest
			&quot;Smart&quot; devices, they basically have sold out on all their existing
			Aladin line customers, still providing no simple, cheap solution to
			download data, nor change the 3 settings via upload that you can't
			change on the device's UI (psi/bar, ppO2, buzzer on/off ).&nbsp; I
			suppose they know the online community exists for the geeks that
			really care about downloading data to their PC anyway... so all's
			good in the end i suppose.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<font size="4">When worlds collide... Pfranc.com meets the online
			Aladin dive community (June '05)</font>
	<p>So fast forward close to ten years from my
		original purple connector cable build experience courtesy of Larry,
		and my first Aladin download-only OpAmp interface buildout courtest
		of Matthias... and I'm living in <a href="http://merware.net/blog">
			Hong Kong</a>.
	<p>And out and about on the streets of HK, there are
		some computer shops here and there where you can find various USB
		dongles (with detailed SMD internals) for ~ US$10-$15.&nbsp; I'm
		talking some pretty impressive stuff, like this
		<a href="http://www.comodow.com/ftjm/ftpd552.htm">Audio adapter</a>
		or
		<a href="http://www.cfih.com/index_product_view.php?did=8801&didpath=/8781/8801&page=1&imgid=87601">
			BT adapter</a> all crammed into a tiny, colorful finished package.&nbsp;
		So i started reaching out to these companies to see if any would be
		interested in manufacturing small quantities of the SMD bidi-OpAmp integrated into an existing USB-&gt;DB9
		serial converters... eg.
		using the existing proven Windows driver as if it were a serial
		device... but removing the DB9, adding in the small circuit, and
		terminating it in the two wires for connectivity to the dive
		computer.&nbsp; All, of course in a nice, small, sealed, finished
		package...
	<p>And so among others with a proven driver, I (re)approached
		Larry at <a href="http://www.pfranc.com">Pfranc.com</a> and we got to talking
		about part# <a href="http://pfranc.com/cgi-bin/P/USB_G4">USB_G4</a>... Aladin,
		meet Pfranc... Pfranc, allow me to introduce you to Aladin.&nbsp; Here's what
		Larry told me...
	<p>&lt;in process-- stay tuned&gt;
