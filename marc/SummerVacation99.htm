about 4:45p and <a href="images/captmarc.jpg"> finished checkout with Neil</a> ~6:15p.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

</span>Bill/Ann had spent the day at Friday Harbour with us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We left Friday Harbour at 6:20p w/them for Deer harbor; used 1.7 gal fuel
(fuel gague at 1.7) for about 40 min cruise.<span style="mso-spacerun:

day called it a night.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Sunday Morning</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">PreCruise Plan:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Cruise around North end of Lopez and East and then South
down Lopez with first Blakely I. and then Decatur I. to the East.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Round Decatur I. and then back North by Decatur I and Blakely I. and
cross West in the 2nd pass (Obstruction Pass).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Head up into Orcas Island's East Sound, maybe spend time at Rosario, and
then meet Trina's folks for the eve.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
is about 20km of cruising. Anchor for the <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">evening
at S. end of Orcas at W. entrance to Obstruction Pass</b>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Leifp suggested that there's a nice marina directly South (Blakely I.
marina).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Actual:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Left Deer (early ~8:30a) for Reid.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Figured we might catchup with Leif and family and hike with
them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Couldn't hail them or catch
them on the phone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Arrived in
~70min.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Engine hours on arrival
read 4812.30, and fuel read 5.5gal. (ie. we used 3.8 gal). and probably avg'ed
about 9-10kt. We Deer harbour, cruised to E of Fawn I., N or Reef I, came up the
E side of Jones I. and then headed on a course of roughly 272 NW cruised up the
N side of Spieden I to the S of Cactus I and numerous other smaller islands
arriving at Reid Harbour. Used NOAA chart 18421 (Strait of Juan De Fuca to
Strait Of Georgia)-- main chart for the area.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Cruise Journal:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There's a neat little harbour up on the top N side of Jones
that looked like a serene place to anchor assuming no wind from the North.
Amazing how nice it is to have the chart plotter; very difficult otherwise to
really see which island is which given that chart doesn't clearly call out some
of the smaller ones (and the bigger ones look smaller off in the distance so
it's hard to tell which are the 'significant' ones). Definitely some current
along Spieden increasing as we went NW.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Up
at the top end there were easily visible eddies which caused the boat to get a
bit squirely.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This was about 40min
into the 70min cruise; at about this time we realized the AC doesn't run from
the ship's power (ie. no inverter) and the fridge hadn't been running.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We powered on the generator at this time and it ran for the next 30min of
our cruising as well as about another 1/2 hour when we met up with Leif, set our
crab pot and got ready to go on a hike.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Other Details:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Nice hike ~5 miles total out to the lighthouse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Here's a small 1 room school house on the way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Good rest stop; can buy t-shirts, get a dixie cup of water.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>On the way back we stopped and played on the swings and checked out the
schoolhouse museum. It had been there, open and closed at various times since
the mid 1700s.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At the light house
we watched numerous large ocean going freighters navigate around the NW point of
the island.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They come up heading N
and then quickly and sharply turn at this point (called <a href="images/PederSein.jpg"> Turn
Pt</a>) to the East (or
at least NE). They're quite close in to the shore when doing this-- you don't
want to be a boat caught in between them and the shore when they do this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>One of the captains on 3 occasions blew his horn 5 times at a trawler
that was on his inside going around this point.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Trina and I plan to <a href="images/SoLongLeif.jpg"> relax and stay here this
eve</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It's a great day weather wise and getting nicer as the hours go by--
currently 16:20. We fired up the generator earlier again (battery was low after
running fridge on DC) at ~15:30 and ran it ~1hr. 16:30. We'll see how long this
lasts with only fridge and VHF running.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Showing
low power when checked at 19:11-- we started the generator; shut it down at
21:30.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Had a great flank steak
dinner<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>on the grill and trina
cooked up red potatoes, sauted mushrooms and a super salad w/cucumbers, feta,
tomatoes and craisins! YUM.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Skipped
the smores this eve-- too full.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Monday Morning</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">PreCruise Plan:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Back West across top of Lopez and then perhaps stop by
Lopez Island's &quot;Blind Bay&quot; (chart 8, spot 15) <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal">bound for Stuart Island's Reid Harbour</b> (chart 8, spot 2). It's about
12km from Blind Bay to Reid Harbour.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Reid
is the South bay... around the top/North of Stuart I. is Prevost Harbour. Leif
suggested that Prevost is less crowded.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Also that Prevost is about a 1/4 hike in (S), and then a nice
3 mile hike West to the lighthouse.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Other notes: Leif’s seen whales to the W side of
Stuart’s Island.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Also, when on route, pass through Pole Pass (N or Crane
Island-not the larger pass to the S)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">0930 Originally got up earlier at about 0600 but went back
to sleep-- my body is healing w/this fresh sea air and extra rest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I'm soaking it up!<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>This is the second night we slept out in the converted galley
rather than the cramped bunked V-birtth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Much
better w/our heads pointing toward the bow, rather than the stern (due to the
slight grade). We fired up the generator, and started frying up smokies, eggs,
potatoes, and coffee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Tide's back
down to 36ft. One day until Trina's birthday! <a href="images/CrabCocktail.jpg"> Time to check the crab pot.</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1115 Shut down the generator.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>We did get a good male keeper (dungeness).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Looks like it's crab cocktail &amp; rum and cokes after our hike later
today!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I think we're going to stay
here again this eve. unless we feel inspired to set sail for Patos later today).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>More likely we'll get in the dingy and explore/hike over by Fossil Bay
after lunch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Heard a Seattle Coast
Guard warning for GPS rollover on 8/21which could result in GPS failure on some
devices-- interesting. Saw a neat center console, inflatable tender (Rendova).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This Vadem/Clio screen is too hard to read at times.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1700hrs Trina and I got back from our 5mi, 2hr hike; we
treked to Ev Henry Pt. and by Shallow Bay, Fox Cove and Fossil Bay on the way.
Just before reaching the point and turning back we were looking out on Parker
Reef (SE with Orcas beyond) and nearby our shore saw a mother Seal swimming with
her calf.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2200hrs Upon return we had quite an appetite so after a
couple quick showers we had dinner for several hours including cheese and
crackers, our fresh crab cocktail and a pound of pasta and salad.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>After finishing the bottle of rum, I managed to beat Trina at chess-- now
it's 1:1, though my win took significantly longer to obtain then hers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>One could rationalize and say that means I'm getting better. :-)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We'll need to add a few things to our master list-- granola bars and/or
trail mix as well as a good sealable water bottle for hikes, and an up-to-date
almanac.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Having some trouble
getting the shower to drain-- tomorrow when we're out crusing again, we'll
sanitize and discharge the holding tank, and hopefully then the drain will work
properly again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We'll leave early
in the morning as we have customs ahead of us tomorrow, in addition to crusing

<p class="MsoNormal">0930 Wind has picked up a tad, and changed direction and is
now out of the NE blowing right into Echo bay. Heading out off the NE tip of
Sucia. Lots of current and reef hazards to watch out for.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Doing 1600rpm and 3gph, but only about 5kt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Slowed down for 10 or so min with some of the edies/currents tossing us
about.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1030 Speed picked up to about 7.5kt below (S side of) Patos
I. toward SE tip of Saturna I. for a fly by.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nice crusing between these two islands.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1050 Heading down along SW along Boundary Pass and will
head into Canadian Customs. Speed up to 10.4kt</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1130 Approaching S. Pender @9.5kt. Planning to head into
customs at Bedwell Hbr.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1200 Docked successfully along the straight pier by
customs!! 4819.55hrs. Was 3rd in line and made it through in a 1/2 hr and it
cost us only about 10 cherries we had to turn over. In return we got an officia
Revenue Canada, Customs Border Services slip of paper with the unique number
V994257 which we'll leave in our dockside window as instructed. They didn't
charge us for the big box of wine which they were entitled to in additition to
our 11 beers and 2 cigars. A little tricky getting off the dock, but I did that
too just like we practiced prior to leaving Friday Hbr. Now around Wallace Pt.
to head up N. through Swanson Channel.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1320 After rounding Mouat Pt on N Pender and crusing
through Otter Bay, as we begin passing Prevost I. Trina and I take turns
showering while the other watches the helm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>While in Otter Bay we heard an interesting soap opera of a gent who hit a
log and has hull vibration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>About
an hour back, we followed the communication w/Victoria Coast Guard, a sailboat
offering help initially but further S than initially thought to be of
assistance, a commericial towing group looking to ambulance chase, and finally a
marina in Ganges where the boat was headed who arranged to haul him out, and was
standing by if he couldn't get in on his own power.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Interesting. Making 8.8kt headway at 1600rpm and 3gph burn.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1345 Ran out of charting ability on the plotter with C-Map
cartridge &quot;San Juan Islands&quot; so found the extra cartridges, the
manual to explain how to switch w/out shorting out the unit, etc and
successfully switched over to &quot;Strait of Georgia&quot; cartridge, found our
position and are continuing to head into port of destination.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1420 We pulled into C dock just starboard of Bill/Ann at
the Ganges Marina.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We're <a href="images/docked.jpg"> literally wedged in between a Grand Banks</a> and a finger dock between us and Bill/Ann. A
fancy bit of docking on my part, helped by the added confidence of having
successfully pulled in and out of customs at Bedwell.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Engine hrs at 4821.36, fuel at 22.3gal.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Other Details:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">0500 auto-bilge is making a groaning noise every few
minutes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I checked in the engine
compartment and in the bilge by the rudder and was happy to see it dry as a
bone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Must be the increased rocking
we're doing, that's flipping a mercury switch and running the pump while dry?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I shut off the auto-bilge for now, but must remember to turn it back on
once underway.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">0900 We were bobbing around quite a bit last night, and
awoke to a perfectly clean swim platform... we lost the crab pot and float.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Didn't tie it down-- stupid. (Another one of those premonitions<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I occasionally have, though don't know it is one until it's just a bit
too late).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At first we went out in
the dingy to see if we could find it floating, along a shore line or tied up on
someone's boat downwind of us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On
the return trip back it occurred to me it simply fell off the stern and the
float is sitting about 10ft below the now 37ft waterline. Visibility is probably
no more than 8ft, and the water's a chilly 52deg.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I thought about jumping in, but all I had to do was dip my head under for
a few seconds with the mast to determine it's just too cold.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The boat was swinging around quite a bit last night, and depth has
changed about 10ft... so there's a pretty good area to cover.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I probably could get away with diving no deeper than 5ft under at which
point I could see the float.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
think I'll opt to buy a new one, stay warm and have a good cup of coffee.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">0930 The Sanx system cleared out.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I guess when it starts getting full it opts to not drain the
shower, in favor of allowing a couple more flushes.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Makes sense to me.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1030 Picturesque little light house on the W tip of Patos.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We'll have to cruise into Active Cove on another trip for a closer look.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1500 and on-- We spent the day with Bill and Ann.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We walked into town and checked out every shop.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Numerous craft shops, a nice local Ace Hardware store (Mouat's), got a
couple bagels for tomorrow's breakfast, got some film. One shop called the
Vortex Gallery had some amazing life size terra cotta sculptures of a woman
sitting (presumably on a dock, grass or beach blanket) rubbing her toes; very
life-like ($6800 canadian). By the Ganges Marina entry from roadside there's a
great fresh seafood shack called &quot;The Fishery&quot; (250)537-2457 or fish@saltspring.com
We skipped the DQ this trip-- but maybe next time if for some reason we end up
in this port again; not sure why though, as it's certainly less scenic than most
of the other harbors we've visited, and the civilization part isn't really
something to write home about. A good stop I suppose to replenish supplies as
there's an ample supermarket stopped in to restock.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Worth noting-- before the foursome called it a night we saw an amazing,
orange full moon rising.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">pre1200hrs while still in Ganges, we headed over to the
marine store the other way from town.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Reminded
me of Barney's in Langley-- very low, old stock.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I suppose West Marine is the demise of any good local, small town marine
shop just as Home Depot has done in the local hardware store. We also made a
quick run back to the hardware store where I replaced our lost crab pot with
another collapsable, closed but mesh round model-- we'll see how it works.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>All in all not bad for $38 canadian. Also, next time we decided if we did
ever go back into Ganges we'd stay at the Saltspring Marina at the farthest end
of the harbor (or simply anchor there along with other boats, unlike what
Waggoner's reports) by the marine shop, rather than the more run down and
overpriced Ganges Marina.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1500 Now at rest in Montague Hbr it occurs to me Trina and
I forgot to play chess last night, after several drinks and a wonderful Salmon,
rice &amp; fresh greens dinner aboard A Bientot with Bill/Ann (not to mention
the fresh crab cocktail for the 2nd night in a row.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>YUM, not to mention that dropped the price of the trip's crab
in half to $30/per, though I effectively raised it by buying the next pot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We must catch some crab over the next couple days! :-)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>All in all a great way to spend Trina's birthday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Tonight Bill/Ann will be joining us aboard the Nordic Queen where we'll
fix then an Anniversary dinner including chicken/red pepper/cherry tomato
skewers on the grill, along w/asparagus and more wine and beer.<span style="mso-spacerun:

</span>Rain has stopped and the <a href="images/fogwisps.jpg"> wisps of fog around the harbor</a> remind me of
mornings over French Polenesia. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Tide's
rising I think-- now showing 43ft.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'll
have to watch it and the anchor line...</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1700 We went into 'town' and checked out the small marina
which had a mart with both food, marine supplies and books, and a quaint little
craft shop where Trina got a nice handmade ceramic fish serving plate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>On the way back we stopped for our tensies (albeit a bit late) and had
shortcake w/orange marmelaid and coffee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Trina's
folks will be by at 1800.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The skies
are clearing and the sun's peaking out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Tide
is coming up-- we're now at 47ft and the anchor is holding and looking good.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2140 Trina's folks just shoved off for ABientot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We had a great meal of skewers on the grill as planned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We punted on the asparagus as it was a bit riper than anticipated, but
instead had rice and a fresh green salad with feta, cherry tomatoes and cukes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>More wine, and then we <a href="images/sunset.jpg"> got up on the pilot house and watched the sunset--
a wonderful red sky</a>, so tomorrow should be a good day. We snapped a few photos
so we'll see how those turn out. The the evening ended with Smores on the grill.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Someone on a nearby boat is playing the violin, and it's quite pleasant
(they're not half bad).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It's time
for Trina and I to resume our chess match.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Oh-- tide is down at 47ft, having peeked a hour back at 49ft.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2150 Some moron is cranking their stereo so loudly that
that's all anyone in the harbor can hear... so much for the violin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I think I may light them up with the several 100k candle power search
light, or offer them a few grand for their stereo if they'll dump it into the
water, if I didn't think they'd appreciate the attention so much.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Fortunately after about 10min. they got board and the sailboat with the
violinist continued their recital.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2325 I was 2 for 2 tonight in chess-- made up for the lost

<p class="MsoNormal">Other Details:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1030 A great morning starting with Capn Crunch on the poop
deck. The 58+ foot wooden Monk design (similar to older wooden Chris Craft has
departed), and the Grinell is still astern.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Both really neat looking, presumably roomy cruisers. We're in 41ft of
water and the anchor's held fine. I added about a 1/2 qt of oil to the main
engine for the first time, and again added a couple ounces of water to the
generator engine as I've done just about every morning. We'll take off shortly
back for the USofA.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1515 I re-anchored at the S side of the bay.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I thought we were walking and rather than reset the anchor there, we opted to go
to the S side because Trina believes we'll experience less ferry wake. We're in
31ft of water.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">???? We went into town for a bit.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Never did find the trailer with the milkshakes, though I
think it was down by the ferry dock which we walked by. There was a small Inn,
restaurant and gallery down the road a piece but nothing special.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We walked back and went back out to the boat-- 'breakin' the law' all the
way, as we neglected to pay the $5 dingy fee for the short time we were ashore.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Appears Otter Bay marina charges for everything, though it is quite tidy,
and has professionally printed signs everywhere about everything.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2045 Sun is setting on the horizon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We're now in 37ft of water.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm
going to let out a tad bit more line--no one is around us, and it's fairly
straight.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I think, from looking around on the shoreline that we're
pretty close to high tide.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
watched the sunset from the bow-- more glowing red sky lingering for up to an
hour after the sun dipped behind the Islands across the way.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2115 I opted not to stow the dingy for the eve. just in
case we need it for some reason.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
set an alarm for 0530 tomorrow morning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ouch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We should get underway by 0600 as we have roughly 22km to Friday Harbor
to go through customs, clean the boat, and return it to the charter group.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We told Bill/Ann we planned to be there by 0900.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Trina and I will play one last game of chess, and then hit the sack.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I think we're going to get plenty of rollers this eve, unless these
ferries stop running for a few hours (though i won't hold my breath); there's
one in port now.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">0840 Into<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Friday
Harbor, San Juan I. and step down from 9kt &amp; make stop at the US Customs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Noone is there so we call in to the Friday Harbor Customs station per the
number in the window (a local 360 number, which I no longer have handy as well
as a 1-800 number).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They cleared us
without much fuss, but did not give us a PIN for future call in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Our clearance number is 420017C.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Other Details:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1200<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
finished up with NW Yacht Charters after refueling (~44gal diesel), scrubbing
and packing out the boat, and transfered our stuff to A Bientot and cruised out
w/Bill and Ann back to Cap Sante Boat Basin the reverse of the way we came.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1230 Stopped in on Dan at Penmar Marine and checked on the
trailer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It did have a boat on it,
though he gave us a story about how he just had moved this wreck onto it, and
had a renter lined up for next week or so at which point he'd contact us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He didn't offer any money... 'we should hear from him soon.'<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>At least he hadn't sold it out from under us... yet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Better than the $70/mo that the local waterski shop offered to store it
for.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I gave him our address and
phone number, again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We won't hold
our breath.</p>
