<h1>Here's Elizabeth...</h1>

<p>1953 1/2 ton Chevy Pickup completely restored ~1990 (frame off restoration)... but still
ready to <a HREF="53haul.jpg">haul refrigerators just like on TV</a> </p>

<p><img SRC="53hood.jpg" width="433" height="290"> </p>

<p>1959 engine block-- <a HREF="53eng.jpg">261cu in. 'straight six' motor</a> (the original '53
had power pressure splash oiling system which Chevy reengineered in the 59 motor which included a proper oil pump. Also worth noting,
 for years i thought it was the more common 235 block, though in '19 when i had <a href="http://eastcoastdragtimeshalloffame.com/2009-hall-of-fame-inductees/">East Coast Drag Racing Hall of Famer</a> <a href="http://drhof.com/2014Inductees.html">(and 2014 DRHoF Inductee)</a>, Bob "Thundershifter" Lee
 rebuild the motor at <a href="http://www.bobsspeedproducts.com/">his Fort Lauderdale shop</a>, including a performance cam... on checking the block serial #s he discovered it was the larger option; here's <a HREF="http://www.1954advance-design.com/Web%20images/261-engine/index.htm">a bit more on the 261 motor</a>), Fenton
headers original equipment piped into custom dual exhaust, uniquely custom Tri power Volvo SU carburetors,
all vacuum system dependencies removed... flawlessly integrated and performs well
resulting in 145hp (originally 90hp.) </p>

<p>Credit for the original (re)build goes to my longtime friend
     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeJfeZP6p20EU9sg6Dv6MFw/videos">Warren Lubow</a> 
     out in Seattle; i got to know him while working on the 1st version of Microsoft Exchange Server 
     for several years prior to our shipping the first version. 
     (add'l related historical detail: his mom who i got to meet by virtue of my friendship w/Warren, 
     <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsofts-mama-dies-first-office-manager-helped-company-grow-up/">
         Miriam Lubow, was Bill Gates' first secretary and company mom</a>). 
         Warren's first love was always cars, and in bewteen and in the midst of any tech job he held 
         he always also had several project cars going. When i took this truck off his hands i think
          he had 5 projects in the works and only 3 bays (2 at his house and 1 at his mom's). 

<p>3 speed manual floor shifter with granny gear (it's actually a 4speed capable <a href="https://www.hemmings.com/stories/article/saginaw-four-speeds">Saginaw</a> tranny currently configured as 3spd), modernized brakes and custom classic
look 15x8 wheels. </p>

<p>completely rewired 12v electrical system (replacing the original 6v system), modern
'Vintage Air' heater box w\defroster and blower (i really need to now add in AC down in Florida ;-) &amp; electric wiper, <a HREF="53int.jpg">stainless
steel VDO classic instrumentation</a> (Speedometer and Amp/Oil/Water Temperature cluster
set), and a modernized stereo including underseat amp and subwoofer along w/BT so i can pickup mobile calls wirelessly and hands free in the cab; i smile everytime i do imagining what the original owner would think if he were transported into the future and riding alongside. </p>

<p>Body work and metallic silver grey Dupont Imron paint done by Scandia Motorsport. Full
length grey and black interior on door panels and headliner. </p>

<p>Initially on my watch the only visible flaw was the <a HREF="53PUbed.jpg">oak bed</a> which had bowed slightly
from exposure to the great Northwest liquid sunshine (not that you could tell from the
picture). I soon worked with a friend (and MSFT colleague) <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/outlook-web-access-a-catalyst-for-web-evolution/ba-p/608860">Bob Gering</a> who had a cabinet shop in his backyard, to
acquire a felled <a href="https://www.trailerdecking.com/products.aspx?FilterstoAdd=524">Apitong</a> tree which we ripped into custom boards and then planed and installed to replace the oak. That said, 
it's going on 3 decades under my care, and while i've kept her mechanically sound or better i'm sorry to say the past decade+ oceanside in FLL haven't been as kind to the body which is no longer without rust.
For at least the past 5 years, i've been of the mind i'll drive her at least another couple decades and then find a kid who's ready to do the next frame off resto.
